# Blog Post Creation Standards

When creating new blog posts:

## Workflow
- Use the `npm run post` script for interactive creation
- Frontmatter must include: title, date, description
- Date format: "January 7, 2025" (Month Day, Year)
- Slug auto-generated from title (lowercase, hyphens, no special chars)
- Place markdown files in `src/posts/`

## Content Standards
- Support Shiki syntax highlighting with these languages: javascript, typescript, json, bash, markdown, svelte, html, css, rust, go, java, python, diff
- Use proper frontmatter format as shown in example post
- Include file attribution in code blocks when relevant: ```rust file="src/main.rs"

## Example Structure
Reference the existing blog post structure: [hello-world.md](mdc:src/posts/hello-world.md)

Example frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: Your Post Title  
date: January 7, 2025
description: Brief description for SEO and post cards
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3] # optional but recommended
---
```

## Technical Implementation
The blog system uses Vite glob imports and MDSvex processing. See configuration: [mdsvex.config.js](mdc:mdsvex.config.js)

Posts are automatically loaded and sorted by date in: [blog.ts](mdc:src/lib/services/blog.ts)
