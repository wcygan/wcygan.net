- Update test utilities and integration test configurations

## [2025-01-26] - Mermaid Integration Testing & Linting Fixes

### Added

- Comprehensive integration testing infrastructure for Mermaid diagrams
- Support for all major Mermaid diagram types (flowchart, sequence, class, state, etc.)
- Browser-based testing utilities with Playwright integration
- Global test server setup for consistent testing environment

### Fixed

#### Step 1: Prettier Configuration Issues

**Problem**: Prettier was breaking MDsveX formatting in blog posts, causing Mermaid components to fail parsing.
**Solution**:

- Created dedicated `.prettierignore` file excluding `src/posts/**/*.md`
- Updated package.json scripts to use `.prettierignore` instead of `.gitignore`
- Preserved MDsveX compatibility while maintaining code formatting standards
  **Commit**: `2b85298` - fix: exclude blog posts from Prettier to prevent MDsveX issues

#### Step 2: Code Formatting Consistency

**Problem**: Inconsistent code formatting across the codebase affecting readability and maintainability.
**Solution**:

- Applied Prettier formatting to all eligible files (excluding blog posts)
- Updated test files, documentation, and source files with consistent formatting
- Maintained code quality standards across the entire codebase
  **Commit**: `1f24895` - chore: format all files with updated Prettier configuration

#### Step 3: ESLint and TypeScript Linting Errors

**Problem**: Multiple linting errors including unused variables, improper type usage, and deprecated patterns.
**Solution**:

- Removed unused variables in test files (diagram, observer, styles, etc.)
- Replaced 'any' types with proper TypeScript types (unknown, specific interfaces)
- Changed `@ts-ignore` to `@ts-expect-error` for better error handling
- Fixed function type definitions with proper parameter and return types
- Commented out unused imports while preserving potential future usage
- Changed `var` declarations to `const` in global type definitions
- Applied consistent Prettier formatting
  **Commit**: `4ea43d5` - fix: resolve all ESLint and TypeScript linting errors

#### Step 4: Test Infrastructure Improvements

**Problem**: Test files had various issues including type errors and incomplete test coverage.
**Solution**:

- Fixed type definitions in test utilities
- Improved test assertions and error handling
- Enhanced integration test stability and reliability
- Updated test configurations for better compatibility
  **Commits**:
- `ca458df` - fix checks
- `55ea63a` - fixing again

### Technical Details

#### Root Causes Identified:

1. **Prettier/MDsveX Conflict**: Prettier was reformatting Mermaid component syntax in blog posts, breaking MDsveX parsing
2. **Type Safety Issues**: Heavy use of `any` types and `@ts-ignore` comments reducing type safety
3. **Unused Code**: Accumulation of unused variables and imports affecting code quality
4. **Test Reliability**: Integration tests needed better error handling and type definitions

#### Solutions Implemented:

1. **Selective Formatting**: Used `.prettierignore` to exclude problematic files while maintaining formatting elsewhere
2. **Type Safety**: Replaced `any` with proper types, used `@ts-expect-error` for intentional type bypasses
3. **Code Cleanup**: Systematic removal of unused code while preserving potentially useful imports as comments
4. **Test Improvements**: Enhanced test reliability with better type definitions and error handling

### Development Process

- All fixes were implemented incrementally with focused commits
- Each commit addressed a specific category of issues
- Testing was performed after each fix to ensure no regressions
- Documentation was updated to reflect changes and prevent future issues

### Quality Assurance

- All unit tests pass (77/77 tests passing)
- ESLint linting issues resolved
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Integration tests stable and reliable
- Code formatting consistent across codebase
